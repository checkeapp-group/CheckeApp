## About The Project

In an age of information overload, CheckeApp provides a powerful tool to help you distinguish fact from fiction. Our mission is to empower users by providing a clear, guided process to verify claims, news articles, or any piece of text.

By leveraging advanced technology, our platform breaks down complex information, identifies key questions, gathers relevant sources, and produces a final, easy-to-understand report, helping you make informed decisions with confidence.

## How It Works: A Simple 4-Step Process

Our platform simplifies the complex task of fact-checking into an intuitive workflow:

1.  **Submit Your Text**: Copy and paste the article, post, or claim you want to verify.
2.  **Refine the Questions**: Our system generates critical questions to guide the investigation. You can edit, add, or delete them to fit your needs.
3.  **Select Your Sources**: We find relevant articles and reports from across the web. You choose the ones you find most credible.
4.  **Get Your Report**: Receive a clear, detailed report with a final verdict, answers to your questions, and links to the sources.

## Key Features

- **Guided Verification**: A step-by-step process that makes fact-checking easy for everyone.
- **Intelligent Question Generation**: Automatically identifies the key questions that need to be answered.
- **User-Controlled Investigation**: You have the final say on the questions and sources used in the analysis.
- **Clear & Shareable Reports**: Get a straightforward summary of the findings that you can easily share with others.
- **Secure User Accounts**: Create a free account to save and manage all your verifications privately.
